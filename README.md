nodeSchoolTry
=============
###Origin plan is angular first , node next. 

###unfortunately i got stuck in the angular ...too much things that i can't understand about it , i have to bear a lot of things to make a further step learning it .

###so maybe it good for me to make some little project , keep my interesting at least . then i find bigger difficult for me to interact with database or sth in the backend without rails . but i don't want to get deeper in the rails .

###so i put my focus on the node , no expect to develop backend immediately , do everything here is just to keep my interesting 

###solving the real problem is the only reason for me to learn program , good luck for me :)
